# Real Time Fluid Simulation

This project aims to understand fluid simulations and explore state-of-the-art methods to achieve real-time results. Throughout this project, I primarily studied the following methods:

- Procedural Generation of Waters (Sum of Sines)
- Marker and Cell Methods
- Adaptive Grids
- Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics
- Position-Based Fluids

In the project files, you can find the CPU implementations of the **Marker and Cell** and **Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics** methods, and GPU implementations of the **Position-Based Fluids** method.

The research process and results are detailed in the reports located in the Docs folder.

The project folder is called PIMA, you can open it as a ususal Unity project. The project is developed with the version 2021.3.21f1
